To resolve this, meticulously follow the installation and linking instructions provided by the library's documentation. For example, if using React Native's linking mechanism, ensure that the necessary steps in the library's README have been carried out. If manual linking is required, carefully follow the steps for adding native code to your project.  Verify that the correct native modules are included and that there are no conflicts between the library's dependencies and your project's dependencies.
